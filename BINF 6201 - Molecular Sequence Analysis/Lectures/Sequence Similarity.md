Sequence Comparisons are critical for discovering gene/protein functions and how these functions evolve. 

Similar Sequences --> Evolutionary Relationship --> Related Function --> Conserved Process

## Types of Similar Sequences
- Homologous Genes
	- Share a common origin
- Orthologous Genes
	- Originate from a single ancestral gene
	- More likely to retain the same // similar functions
- Paralogous Genes
	- Related via duplication
	- Can have different evolutionary trajectories
		- They can lose functions
		- Gain novel functions
		- Become more specialized

> [!NOTE] What does this mean.
> Sequence Similarity does not mean they are homologous. Identifying orthologs (and distinguishing them from paralogs) can be more complicated. This usually involves comparisons of sequence similarity along with comparisons of genomic context and shared history with other species.


## Visually Comparing Sequence Similarity

### The Dot-Plot Method
**If you have 2 sequences you want to compare you create what is called a dot-plot**
