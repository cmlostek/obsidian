The **Protein Data Bank** (PDB) is a publicly accessible repository of three-  
dimensional (3D) structural data of biological macromolecules, such as proteins,  
nucleic acids, and complex assemblies. It serves as a critical resource for  
researchers studying molecular biology, biochemistry, and related fields.

1. Explain what type of data is stored in PDB? Who are the end-users of PDB?  
2. List at least three possible metadata for PDB records. How are they useful? Add  
screenshots if needed.  
3. What type of data models PDB implements and how does it help curation,  
visualization, statistical analyses etc?  
4. How does the PDB ensure that data from different users are consistent and  
standardized?
