A __modern database__ implies a computer based file management system which is _efficient, reliable, convenient, secure, and a persistent resource._ It needs to have multi-user availability, and has the ability / potential to store large amounts of data and efficiently access them. 

### Efficiency, Reliability, Convenience
- Rules which allow quick, reproducible and memory efficient way to retrieve complicated patterns of data
### Persistence
- The data is intended to outlast any programs that execute on the data. Once a program operates on a data set the data generated goes away. 
### Security
- Ensure the data and the users are protected from potential malware and other attacks.

## Database Management System
> A software application suite whose algorithms are based on the rules of the data model and schema you have chosen and provide a range of other services. 
- The schema can be built / imported
- Data can be imported, exported, secured, etc.
- Data can be queried / manipulated
- An API (Application Programming Interface) for processing / visualization programs
- Facilities for securities, user management, change, etc.
